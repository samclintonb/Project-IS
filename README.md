# Client Management System

## Overview

This is a basic proof-of-concept Client Management System built as part of the Programming for Information Systems module at Dublin Business School (Module Code: B9IS123).

The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete client records using a simple web interface. It is designed to simulate how a small company might manage their client data.

## Features

- Add a new client
- View a list of clients
- Update client details
- Delete a client
- Basic client data stored in a local JSON file (mock database)
- API-based architecture (frontend makes requests to backend)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- JSON for backend mock database
- (Planned: Node.js or Flask for API backend)
