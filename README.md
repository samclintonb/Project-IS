# Client Management System

## Overview

This is a basic proof-of-concept Client Management System built as part of the Programming for Information Systems module at Dublin Business School (Module Code: B9IS123).

The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete client records using a simple web interface. It is designed to simulate how a small company might manage their client data.

## Features

- Add a new client
- View a list of clients
- Update client details
- Delete a client
- Basic client data stored in a local JSON file (mock database)
- API-based architecture (frontend makes requests to backend)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- JSON for backend mock database
- (Planned: Node.js or Flask for API backend)

## Architecture & Workflow

User fills in the client form and clicks "Save"

Data is sent to the Express API (POST / PUT)

Backend inserts/updates data in SQLite database

Table refreshes via GET request to display updated list

Users can edit/delete existing clients

All frontend-backend communication is done via fetch() calls (API-based, not post-refresh)

## Testing Summary

Manual unit tests for each feature (add, edit, delete, validation, search)
